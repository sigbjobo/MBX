 * @brief Calculates the repulsion contribution for a given pair of atoms for all apirs in the system.
 *
 * Given a pair of atoms, and the buckingham constants, it calculates the buckingham contribution for all pairs
 * involving atom 1 and all the atoms of type 2. The coordinates of the second atom are in vectorized form.
 * @param[in] a Linear constant of the Born-mayer expression A*exp(-br)
 * @param[in] b Non-linear constant of the Born-mayer expression A*exp(-br)
 * @param[in] p1 Pointer to double array with the coordinates of atom1. Length is 3.
 * @param[in] xyz2 Pointer to double array with the coordinates of atom2. The origin of the pointer is the first
 * coordinate of the monomer type 2, and will be in xxxxx[at1]yyyyy[at1]zzzzzz[at1]xxxx[at2]... and so on. See the
 * reordering function for more details.
 * @param[in,out] grad1 Pointer to a double array that accumulates teh gradients in atom 1
 * @param[in,out] grad2 Pointer to a double array that will store the gradients for all atoms in monomer 2 that are
 * involved in the energy
 * @param[in] nmon1 Number of monomers of type 1. Should always be 1.
 * @param[in] nmon2 Number of monomers of type 2.
 * @param[in] start2 Index of the first monomer of type 2 that will have the repulsion energy calculated. This is meant
 * for parallel calculations. See Buckingham class implementation.
 * @param[in] end2 Index of the last monomer of type 2 that will have the repulsion energy calculated. This is meant for
 * parallel calculations. See Buckingham class implementation.
 * @param[in] atom_index1 Index of the atom of monomer type 1 involved.
 * @param[in] atom_index2 Index of the atom of monomer type 2 involved.
 * @param[in] do_grads Gradients will be calculated if set to true.
 * @param[in] cutoff Distance for which the pairs will be assumed to have interaction 0.
 * @param[in] box Box of the system
 * @param[in] box_inverse Inverse of the box matrix
 * @param[in] use_ghost Will use ghost atoms if true
 * @param[in] islocal
 * @param[in] isl1_offset
 * @param[in] isl2_offset
 * @param[in,out] virial Virial tensor of teh system
 * @return Sum of all the repulsion energies for all the atoms involved in the pair i,j
